# 3D Rack Builder

This repository contains a simple Three.js based demo that lets you design a server rack layout in the browser.

Open `index.html` in a modern browser. Use the form in the top left corner to choose an equipment type, label, starting rack unit and height in U. Click **Add Equipment** to place the item in the virtual rack. 

Equipment types are rendered with different colors:

- Servers: gray
- Routers: blue
- Patch panels: green
- Blanking plates: black

The example uses assets delivered from the [unpkg](https://unpkg.com) CDN, so internet access is required.
